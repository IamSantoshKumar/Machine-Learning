Distributed DeepLearning Systems To Detect Fraudulent Transaction :-

I have chosen AutoEncoder Model to detect the fraudulent data:

"Autoencoding" is a data compression algorithm where the compression and decompression functions are 
1) data-specific, 
2) lossy, and 
3) learned automatically from examples rather than engineered by a human. Additionally, in almost all contexts where the term "autoencoder" is used, the compression and decompression functions are implemented with neural networks.

Elephas is an extension of Keras,which allows you to run distributed deep learning models at scale with Spark. Elephas currently supports a number of applications, including:

Data-parallel training of deep learning models,
Distributed hyper-parameter optimization,
Distributed training of ensemble models
Schematically, elephas works as follows.
