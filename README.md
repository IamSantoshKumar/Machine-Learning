Elephas is an extension of Keras,which allows you to run distributed deep learning models at scale with Spark. Elephas currently supports a number of applications, including:

Data-parallel training of deep learning models,
Distributed hyper-parameter optimization,
Distributed training of ensemble models
Schematically, elephas works as follows.
